- Files has 10 direct blocks, and can use indirect block if needed

Future Improvements:
- ../ directory for root inode
- Handle error if filesystem is full and a write is requested
- Symbolic links
- Remove hardcoded disk size limit

Completed Features:
- Can touch files anywhere, even in nested directories

- Can remove files from anywhere, even in nested directories
- Can remove directories, as long as lowest level directory is specified
- Can rename/move files properly (with data intact)
