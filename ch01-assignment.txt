In this assignment, you will write a Unix shell like "bash" called "nush".

A shell operates as follows:

    Accept an optional script file as the first command line argument.
    If there's no script, show a prompt. Your prompt should be "nush$ ". Command input is accepted on the same line after the prompt.
    Read one line of commands from either stdin or the script.
    Execute that line of commands.
    Repeat until EOF or an "exit" command. 

Command lines are made up of:

    Programs to execute.
    Built-in commands.
    Command line arguments to programs / builtins.
    Operators. 

Programs to Execute

    nat@masaru:hw05$ ./nush 
    nush$ head -n 2 /usr/share/dict/words
    A
    A's
    nush$ 

Given a program to execute, like "head" above, your shell will do three things:

    fork(), to create a new process.
    in the child process, exec(), to execute the requested program, passing through the three command line arguments
    in the parent process, wait() or waitpid(), to allow the program to finish before executing another command 

Built-in Commands

    nush$ pwd
    /home/nat/Teaching/3650/hw05
    nush$ cd tests
    nush$ pwd
    /home/nat/Teaching/3650/hw05/tests
    nush$ exit
    nat@masaru:hw05$

Some commands aren't programs to execute, they're things that the shell should handle itself. You should implement two of these:

    The "cd" command changes the current directory. This means calling chdir() to change the state of your shell process.
    The "exit" command exits the shell. 

In bash, lots of commands that are available as programs are actually built-in for efficiency, like pwd, echo, etc. Your shell should just run these as programs.

Operators

    nush$ sort tests/sample.txt | tail -n 3
    remorselessly
    revolutionized
    underplays
    nush$ 

Operators either modify the behavior of one command or chain together multiple commands into a single command line.

Your shell should support seven operators:

    Redirect input: sort < foo.txt
    Redirect output: sort foo.txt > output.txt
    Pipe: sort foo.txt | uniq
    Background: sleep 10 &
    And: true && echo one
    Or: true || echo one
    Semicolon: echo one; echo two 

To submit:

    C Source code.
    A Makefile that builds your program.
    In a gzipped tarball, in a "challenge01" directory. 

Don't submit:

    Your compiled binary, object files, or other build artifacts.
    The "tmp" directory created by the tests.
    Stray hidden files. 

Your source code should pass clang-check with no warnings.

Check your program with valgrind to make sure you have no memory allocation issues.

This is the first challenge assignment. It's not easy. Get a couple of tests to pass, and submit to make sure they pass the autograder. Then get a couple more tests to pass, etc.

The last couple tests are pretty hard. I expect less than half of the class to pass all the tests and get a 100%.

Expected time to complete this assignment with most test passing is 14 hours
